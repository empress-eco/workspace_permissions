## About The Project

### ðŸ“– Overview
Workspace Permissions empowers system administrators to manage workspace visibility based on user roles, fostering a secure, efficient, and organized working environment. 

### ðŸŒŸ Key Features
- Configure workspace visibility based on user roles.
- Use both whitelist and blacklist methods for role-based access control.
- Special handling for "Administrator" user, ensuring unrestricted access.
- Hide section names when no workspaces are available.

This solution is built with Empress/ Empress v13, providing a seamless integration for users of this framework.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
You need to have Empress/ Empress v13 installed and running on your system.

### Installation
Follow these steps to install Workspace Permissions on your self-hosted site:

```sh
# Navigate to your Empress-bench directory
cd Empress-bench

# Clone the app from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/empress-eco/workspace_permissions.git

# Replace 'MY_SITE' with your site name and install the app
bench --site MY_SITE install-app workspaceperms

# Execute the seeds to modify Empress/Empress/boot.py
bench execute workspaceperms.seeds.execute

# Restart the bench for the modifications to take effect
bench restart
```

## Usage

1. Go into "Workspace Perms List" via the awesome bar.
2. Add a new `Workspace Perms` document.
3. Select the relevant workspace.
4. Set the permissions ("Visible To Roles" and/or "Hidden to Roles") as per your scenario.

For importing multiple Workspace Perms, consider preparing a xlsx-file and use the "Data Import" feature.
